Installation Instructions
=========================

Every time a new update is added to the Mu software (https://github.com/ntoll/mu) a build is 
automatically triggered and the resulting application uploaded here with a time stamp on its
file name.

There are currently two available formats for the Mu software, the mu-<date> binary file, and the
mu-<date>.deb package file. 


The binary file is a self-contained executable with everything included. This should be able to
run in most Rasbian Jessie installations, but there might be incompatibilities with older
versions.
To run the software first make sure that the file is executable, so on the command line:

> chmod +x <mu-file-path>
> ./<mu-file-path>


The deb package contains only the program data, so it will need an internet connection to install
the dependencies. This deb package should be able to work in most Debian based distributions.
To install Mu execute the following on the command line:

> sudo dpkg -i <mu.deb-file-path>
> sudo apt-get -f install
